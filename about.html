        <p class="text" > Welcome to our mystery machine! We are TurboHedgehos (from left: Weronika, Erika, Michael, Simon, Klaudia and Josh) and we love to travel. We are a group of students that love adventures and exploring new places. We decided to create the society in order to share our passion with others that are willing to participate in amazing trips to various places. Expeditions around the Aberdeen City or long journeys through seas and oceans - we are open to both!  </p>

        <p class="text"> Our aim is to discover as much as it is possible. The sad fact is we are unlikely to see every beautiful place in the world, although, we do everything we can, to make the list of places we have been to longer than the list of dream destinations. We choose low costs and enjoy the journey as much as what awaits us in the end of it.  </p>

        <p class="text"> We believe in mutual respect, open-mindedness and adventure! We are not afraid of challanges and we never give up before achieving our goals. Can you say the same about yourself? Maybe you'd like to? In any case, join us and help us finding new places to explore! </p>
